# Hello_world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow

# My First and Simple Git Repository
This is my first attempt to create a Git repository on GitHub.
The goal here is to learn how to create and maintain a repository.
I am interested (among other things) in:
- Adding and managing files online
- Clone locally my repository
- Making and committing changes locally
